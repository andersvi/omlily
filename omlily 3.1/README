COMPATIBILITY

* This Library is compatible with OpenMusic 6.x 
* It runs on Linux and MacOsX plateforms


INSTALLATION


Install the folder 'omlily 3.x' in your OpenMusic desired path. 


LINUX 

Once loaded, the library will automatically query the Lilypond binary in your path.
It will also query for xpdf reader. You can change these options in OpenMusic preferences in the External tab.


MACOSX


In order to have the library automatically compile your *.ly file, you will need, beside the standard installation of Lilypond.app, to configure the command-line link to the application as described here in the "Running on the command-line":

http://www.lilypond.org/website/macos-x.html




USAGE



OM->LILY

om->lily will export and compile VOICE, POLY, CHORD-SEQ and MULTI-SEQ objects into lilypond *.ly files.
It has two modes for generating the score according to the nature of the polyphony:

   -Generic: for most of the music that is set without polymetrics and polytempi.
   -Polymetric : for special cases where music is polymetric and polytempic music


LILY->OM

In order to import *.ly files into OpenMusic objects (POLY), you will have to :

1) Uncomment the following 3 lines found in your *.ly generated file :

   
\score { 
 { 

...


% #(with-output-to-file "temp.lisp" --> uncomment
% (lambda () #{ \displayMusic {     --> uncomment

...

% } #}))   --> uncomment

} 
 

2) After removing '%' you should recompile your file with lilypond. This will produce a "temp.lisp" file

3) Connect lily->om to the first input of a POLY object (<self>) or CRTL+SHIFT+CLICK the output of lily->om in order to create a POLY instance.



Important:

The Lilypond/Openmusic communication will work ONLY with om->lily generated files. 

- "barchecks" are mandatory. If they are absent this will output erronous rhtyhms.

If not, please be really carefull when :

1) In case of a single voice, or a single PianoStaff to group them between << and >> in the Score section

2) For general cases of music, put bar checks after each measures.

3) In case of PianoStaff cross-staff notation, this will not render as a cross-staff in OM. Hence all notes will stay on the same staff.

PianoStaff is not yet integrated nor the CHORD-SEQ export.


PREFERENCES


The preference panel under the Lilypond tab :

-Title 	       : sets the title of the score.

	-Compilation mode : sets the compilation mode generic/polymetric according to
		     	    the given music.

	-Export Dynamics  : if checked, all dynamics will be exported without repetition.
	-Export Midi	  : if checked, will compile also a midi file.

-Paper Size	: sets the paper size a4/a3.

-Orientation	: sets portait/landscape.
